 Data Structures 303 Assignment 3 - Brady Maes

The code can be tested with for the map part completely by just running the program and testing different inputs. If you wanted to test the move_to_rear function you
would have to add a queue to main and check its values to make sure it updated correctly. If you wanted to test the palindrome code, you can change the palindromeTester
variable on line 38 to test different strings. However, I do provide screenshots of different cases for this.
